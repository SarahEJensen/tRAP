This set of files is used to create what would become Supplemental Table S3, to determine feature importances in the final model, and feature importances. After running this script, I manually re-ordered the tRNA genes, added color, and renamed several of the column headers. mmchromatin.txt results from an analysis of data from Bogu et al 2015, where cells with 5 or 7 indicate active transcription of that tRNA (row) in that tissue (column). The mouse_liver_1.bed file was also used to create the scatterplots in Figure 3, which compare prediction probability scores with ChIP-seq read counts. The "NoAnnotation" files ignore any feature data gained through use of genome annotation files to demonstrate comparable accuracy of the classifier without using annotations.
