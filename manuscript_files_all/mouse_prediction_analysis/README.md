This set of files is used to create what would become Supplemental Table S3, to determine feature importances in the final model, and feature importances. After running this script, I manually re-ordered the tRNA genes, added color, and renamed several of the column headers. mmchromatin.txt is data from Bogu et al 2015, where cells with 5 or 7 indicate active transcription of that tRNA (row) in that tissue (column).
