To analyze Pol III ChIP-seq data, we lifted over (if necessary) to accomodate differences between Kutter et al 2011 and the assembly used in the Cactus graph (see Supplemental Table S4). Then we mapped ChIP-seq peaks to tRNA genes using the liftOver files. The files in this directory are all analyses of data from Kutter et al 2011 and were used in conjunction to create the scatterplots in Figure 3, comparing prediction probabilities to ChIP-seq read counts. createFig3.py generates these scatterplots and does the same for DM-tRNA-seq data.
