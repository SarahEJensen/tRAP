We installed RevBayes and wrote and ran the code listed in the file file fit_revbayes_models.txt to fit phylogenetic models of discrete character evolution to our data, as well as to generate the transition probability matrices associated with the best-fitting models. The TimeTree and species character matrices are included in this directory (files with .nex extension), as is the {ython script used to generate these files (getNex.py).
