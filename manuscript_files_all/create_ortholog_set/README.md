These scripts were used to generate the ortholog set analyzed in our manuscript. To generate this, we wrote and ran makeMapAll.py and oneToOneMapAll.py to analyze .maf files extracted from the Cactus graph. We then wrote and ran the matchOrthologSets scripts in order to incorporate ortholog data from Holmes 2018, and then removeSegDupsFromAlignment.py to get rid of species-specific segmental duplications.
